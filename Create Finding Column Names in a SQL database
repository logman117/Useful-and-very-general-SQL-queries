-- this is probably the most useful SSMS query I have in my arsenal. I hope it serves you well!

select
c.name as 'Columnname',
t.name as 'tablename'
from sys.columns c

--you can adjust tables to Views if you want to look in there as well
join sys.tables t on c.object_id = t.object_id
--join sys.views t on c.object_id = t.object_id

where c.name like '%LineNum%'
order  by 
t.name,
c.name;
